A. How to build VIPSimulator docker image from Dockerfile manually:

1) Install Docker:
   sudo apt-get install docker-engine

2) Start the docker daemon:
   sudo service docker start

3) Build VIPSimulator docker image from Dockerfile:
   docker build -f /path/to/Dockerfile -t vipsimulator .

   -This step may last for 15-20 mins 
   -Finally, this image will contain Simgrid, log2sim and vipsimulator and the size
    will be around 1GB


B. How to launch the simulation in docker image:


1) Run docker image and mount a shared folder between container and os by -v:
   docker run -it --rm vipsimulator /bin/bash


2) Retrieve the data in image: svn checkout https://github.com/anchenchai/Dockerfile_VIPSimulator/trunk/Example/workflow-1ZGvD5

3) cd workflow-1ZGvD5

4) Prepare input files for simulator:
   generate the deployment, platform and launcher file by:

   ${LOG2SIM_HOME}/deployment_generator.R workflow-1ZGvD5
   ${LOG2SIM_HOME}/platform_generator.R workflow-1ZGvD5
   ${LOG2SIM_HOME}/launcher_generator.sh workflow-1ZGvD5 yes

5) Launch simulation:
   sh run_simulations_workflow-1ZGvD5.sh 

   Finally, the simulation results can be found in folder "/workflow-1ZGvD5/csv_files"

       

Notes:
   -More data of workflows can be downloaded from : https://figshare.com/articles/Companion_of_the_article_on_Modeling_Distributed_Platforms_from_Application_Traces_for_Realistic_File_Transfer_Simulation_/4253426/3

   -You can download the data locally and then mount it in the container with "-v" option when running the image:
    
   docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/workflows:/container/data vipsimulator /bin/bash

   Then the data can be found in folder /container/data in container.

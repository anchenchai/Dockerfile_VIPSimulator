How to build VIPSimulator docker image from Dockerfile:

1) Install Docker:
   sudo apt-get install docker-engine

2) Start the docker daemon:
   sudo service docker start

3) Build VIPSimulator docker image from Dockerfile:
   docker build -f /path/to/Dockerfile -t vipsimulator .

   -This step may last for 15-20 mins 
   -Finally, this image will contain Simgrid, log2sim and vipsimulator and the size
    will be around 1GB

4) Run docker image and mount a shared folder between container and os by -v:
   docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/Dockerfile_VIPSimulator/Example/workflow-1ZGvD5:/container/test vipsimulator /bin/bash

   -More data of workflows can be downloaded from : https://figshare.com/articles/Companion_of_the_article_on_Modeling_Distributed_Platforms_from_Application_Traces_for_Realistic_File_Transfer_Simulation_/4253426/3

   All workflows are in folder data.tgz. 
    
5) Prepare input file for simulator:
   go to the /Example/workflow-1ZGvD5.
   In /workflow-1ZGvD5, generate the deployment, platform and launcher file by:

   ${LOG2SIM_HOME}/deployment_generator.R workflow-1ZGvD5
   ${LOG2SIM_HOME}/platform_generator.R workflow-1ZGvD5
   ${LOG2SIM_HOME}/launcher_generator.sh workflow-1ZGvD5 yes


6) Launch simulation:
   sh run_simulations_workflow-1ZGvD5.sh 

   Finally, the simulation results can be found in folder "/workflow-1ZGvD5/csv_files"
